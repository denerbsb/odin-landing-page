# The Odin Landing Page

This is the first hands on, do it yourself, project from "The Odin Project" curriculum, the goal here was to try to replicate a website by myself.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

This was built using only HTML and CSS. The focus of this project was to put to practice concepts of HTML and CSS and try to repliace a website by just looking at a screenshot. The main goal was to feel and understand how HTML and CSS works and try to put together some basic layout and style.

## Optimizations

This project does not follow the best practices of responsiveness for mobile or accessibility yet. In the future, as the i advance in the content of the course, i will update this website to be responsive and to have accessibility features and improve what needs to be improved.

## Lessons Learned:

This project was perfect to learn how HTML and CSS works together and to understand how flexbox and containers works. With the "do it yourself" mentality i had to try to figure things out by myself or do research, each section of the website took me hours to make because of trial and error and it was awesome to really grasp some concepts of flexbox.
